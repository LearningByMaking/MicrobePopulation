; There are eight digital IO pins total. They are in slots 4
; through 11 (the One-Wire being slot 1). The digital IO
; pins are on ports 5, 4 and 3, and their individual pins on
; the CPU are 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 4.0, 4.1, 3.6 and 3.7. 
;
; Note that pins on the CPU are distinct from pins on the dev
; board. This is an unfortunate coincidence of nomenclature.
; Perhaps we should call the dev board pins "slots" or
; something, but we don't.
;

; All i/o pins must be set as either an input or an output. This 
; is done by setting the direction register assosiated with each 
; pin. If the specific bit at the given register is set to one,
; it will be set as an output, and if it is set to zero, it will
; be set as an input.
;
; In addition to this, all i/o pins must be enabled to operate 
; as a general purpose i/o pin and disable their other modes
; of operation.

; This section creates words that allow the i/o pins to be 
; set as high or low, or to read a supplied signal as either 
; high or low.
;
; To set a pin high or low the output register for the
; associated pin must be set. If this register is set to zero,
; the output is set to low, and if the register is set to one, 
; the output is set high.
;
; To read a pin, the associated input register must be read.
; If the pin is supplied with a voltage, the register will be
; set to one, and of the pin is not supplied, the register
; will be set to zero.

; EXAMPLES:
;
; Using an i/o pin as an output to create a square wave:
;
; dp1enable   (Sets pin to i/o mode)
; dp1output   (Sets pin to output mode)
;
; loop [
;    dp1on
;    wait 1
;    dp1off
;    wait 1
; ]
;
; Using an i/o pin as an input to continually check for a 
; supplied signal:
;
; dp1enable   (Sets pin to i/o mode)
; dp1input    (sets pin to input mode)
;
; loop [
;    if dp1read = 1 [ prs "High ]
;    if dp1read = 0 [ prs "Low ]
;    wait 1
; ]
;

; Unnecessary command that has been grandfathered in 
; because it is used by other words.
